About
=====

Gears for Android(TM) is a heavily modified port of the infamous "gears" demo to Android.

The Gears demo is an open source project intended to help developers learn how to create
OpenGL ES programs on Android. The Gears demo was originally written by Brian Paul as
part of the Mesa3D project. My implementation includes variations for Java/OpenGL ES 1.x,
Java/C/OpenGL ES 1.x and Java/C/OpenGL ES 2.0. I have also added several features not
found in the original implementation including touch screen support, VBOs and an
on-screen FPS counter.

The FPS (frames-per-second) counter is often used as a benchmark metric for graphics
programs. On Android the frame rate is limited by v-sync (typically 60 FPS) which is
the fastest rate that a display can refresh the screen. Since Gears is capable of
rendering much faster than v-sync on most devices it provides limited benchmarking
value.
